3. **Add to Vercel**: In your Vercel project settings, add environment variable:
   - Name: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Resend API key
4. **Verify Domain**: Add your domain to Resend (or use their test domain)

### Option 2: Use SendGrid

1. **Sign up for SendGrid**: Create account at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. **Get API Key**: Generate API key in SendGrid dashboard
