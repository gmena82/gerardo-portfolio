# What a Week!

Wow. What a productive week!

We kicked things off with our first commissioned documentary style piece for a nonprofit that needed it—fast—for a horse show in Las Vegas. It was headed to the jumbotron, which meant every pixel had to be perfect. We tightened the cut and survived brutal high end render times.

Then it rolled. All those tiny choices we sweated at 2 a.m. showed up big and clean. We're proud of what the team pulled off in such a short window.

## The Harding Project: Speed, Truth, and AI

Then we followed that up with a presentation on AI imagery and video for the Harding Project conference—tied to the U.S. Army's branch journals. We walked through the top trends in AI and how to put them to work for graphic design and video editing: ideation to mood boards, concept frames to quick cuts, and the latest in trends and legal happenings. Not everyone agreed on everything, which was the point, and what made the conference so beautiful. The discussions and breakouts were sharp—smart questions, real concerns, and a lot of useful pushback. Iron sharpening iron.

I left grateful to be a part of all of it.

## Onwards

Exhausting? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. On to the next project. Our queue is already full again.
